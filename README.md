# Classification-of-Mushroom

# Mushrooms Basics Concepts 
A mushroom, or toadstool, is the fleshy, spore-bearing fruiting body of a fungus, typically produced above ground on soil or on its food source.
The standard for the name “mushroom” is the cultivated white button mushroom, Agaricus bisporus; hence the word “mushroom” is most often applied to those fungi (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) that have a stem (stipe), a cap (pileus), and gills (lamellae, sing. lamella) on the underside of the cap. “Mushroom” also describes a variety of other gilled fungi, with or without stems, therefore the term is used to describe the fleshy fruiting bodies of some Ascomycota. These gills produce microscopic spores that help the fungus spread across the ground or its occupant surface.

# Requirements
  - NumPy : For fast matrix operations.
  - pandas : For analysing and getting insights from datasets.
  - matplotlib : For creating graphs and plots.
  - seaborn : For enhancing the style of matplotlib plots.
  - scikit-learn -Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

# Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:
> pip install numpy
> 
> pip install pandas
>
